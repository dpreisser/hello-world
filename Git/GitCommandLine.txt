0) a) git --help:
      Get help for git in general.
   b) get help <command>:
      Get specific help for the <command>.

1) git config:
   a) --list: To see what keys are already there.
   b) --get <item>: 1 value; --get-all <item>: all values
      Examples: git config --get-all user.name
      		git config --get-all user.email
                git config --get-all merge.tool
                git config --get-all mergetool.bc3.cmd
		
   c) --global: Set keys in the global config file.
      Examples: git config --global user.name "your name"
      		git config --global user.email "your email"

2) git init:
   Must be called in the directory where work with git is intended.

3) git clone <repository>; git clone <protocol>://github.com/user.name/<repository>:
   Make a local copy from the remote repository.
   <protocol>: ssh, https, file, git, ...
   <repository>: name of repository

4) git log:
   Retrieve information about the history.
   a) --graph: Display inheritance graph.
   b) --decorate: Diplay where master and branches end (respective HEAD).
   c) --pretty=oneline; --oneline: shorten the output per log entry to one line.
   d) --pretty=<format>
      <format>: oneline, short, medium, full, fuller, ...
   e) --name-status: What type of change: Addition, Deletion, Merge.

5) git add <file name>; git add *; git add <directory>:
   Adding a single file, files or directories.
   This is also necessary if file has changes.

6) git status:
   Shows the status of the active branch.
   Files which have changed or files which are not added to git.

7) Branches are versions of the same repository.
   One branch is always there and is called master.

   a) git branch: Shows the branches and which one is active (marked with *).
   b) git branch <branch>: Creates a new <branch> without making it active.
   c) git branch -d <branch>: Deletes <branch>.

8) a) git checkout <branch>: Switch to existing <branch>.
   b) git checkout -b <branch>: Creates a new <branch> and makes it active.

9) git commit <file> -m "your message":
   Make the change to the local active branch and not to the remote repository.

10) a) git remote add <your memo> <protocol>://github.com/user.name/<repository>:
       <your memo> is now an abbreviation of <protocol>://github.com/user.name/<repository>.
    b) git remote -v:
       Lists all your memos.
    
11) git push <your memo> <branch>:
    Submits the changes to the remote repository and branch.

12) git pull:
    Gets the latest changes from the remote repository.

13) git checkout -- <file>:
    Undo local changes to <file> if not committed.

14) git revert <commit1> <commit2> ...; git revert <commit1>..<commit2>:
    Revert the corresponding commits with another commit.

15) git fetch <your memo>; git reset --hard <your memo>/master:
    These 2 commands are needed if changes should be unrolled and
    these are already committed to the local repository.

16) git reset --<modifer> <commit>:
    If <commit> is omitted HEAD is assumed.
    <modifier>:
    a) soft: only HEAD will be changed
    b) mixed: Additionally the index will be changed.
    c) hard: Additionally the work tree will be changed.
    d) merge: Merges changes between HEAD and <commit> into relevant files.
       	      Not possible if file in work tree is also different to the index
	      that means if file in work tree has also unadded changes.
    e) keep: Merges changes between HEAD and <commit> into relevant files.
       	     Not possible if file in working tree is also different to HEAD.

15) git rebase foo bar:
    This needs some explanation:

    Assume three branches with letters A, B, C, ... to mark the sequence of commits
    (instead of dealing with hash keys):
    Branch bar: A, B, C, D, E
    Branch foo: Departing from commit B: F, G, H
    Branch baz: Departing from C: I, J, K

    In a first step this is equivalent to:

    git checkout foo
    git checkout -b newbar
    git cherry-pick C, D, E

    After this:

    foo points still to commit H.

    newbar points to the new head N:
    Changes B->C commit L (H->L)
    Changes C->D commit M (L->M)
    Changes D->E commit N (M->N)

    branches bar and baz are unchanged.

    In a subsequent second step this is equivalent to:

    git checkout bar
    git reset --hard newbar
    git branch -d newbar

    branch foo points still to commit H.
    branch bar points to commit N.
    branch baz is unchanged.

    Commits D and E will be deleted since they are not accessible by any branch
    (git garbage collection).
